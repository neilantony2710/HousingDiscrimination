A website to visualize the results of my research on housing discrimination in the US.
Deployed at https://glistening-rolypoly-6edf61.netlify.app/

To view how I analyzed the dataset, look at DataAnalysis.py. *Note that the ./data directory does not exist in the repo because the data files are too large( >6 GB ).
